# RNA
The data used was generated from the HeCaToS project and the analysis was perfomed for my bachelor thesis.
1. The sequencing and analysis steps of total RNA include: trimming, quality control, gene quantification and differential analysis.
The analysis was of 3 compounds using DESeq2 to find DEGs. Quantile filtering and spurious filtering were performed.
These DEGs will then be used for pathway enrichment on REACTOME.
2. The sequencing and analysis steps of miRNA include: annotation, merging of results and differential analysis.
The analysis was of the same compounds as the totalRNA and the results will be used for increased information on the effected pathways.
