# RNA
The sequencing and analysis steps of total RNA, including: trimming, quality control, gene quantification and differential analysis.
The analysis was of 3 compounds using DESeq2 to find DEGs. Qualtile filtering and spurious filtering.
These DEGs will then be used for pathway enrichment on REACTOME.
